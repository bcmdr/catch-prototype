# Catch

## Write Now. Without Worry.

the good news is we have markdown. So that's progress. 

What do I want? I want that blogging scene from the Social Network. You know the one. Go. The music is a nice taste. 

So what do we really want? We want a way to quickly capture thoughts from the terminal? Why? Because we like the terminal. Why not? Let's try it. 

First step is realizing where I want to work, which is terminal. Terminal is dangerous though so let's create a wrapper to catch my thoughts. I don't like writeroom though. That's already a thing. How about... catch.

Change thoughts to readme...

And instantly I'm in love. I get it. The point is to start and allow the process to take over. Let's keep going. Welcome to catch.
